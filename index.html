                    <h1>Autism And Synesthesia May Have A Genetic Link, New Twin Study Reveals</h1>
                    <p>Throughout history, twin studies have yielded some incredible scientific insights  NASA even sent one of a pair of identical twins to space. The opportunity to study this unique group is too good to pass up, and now a new analysis of twin data has drawn a fascinating link between autism and the mysterious phenomenon of synesthesia.

                        <br>Many people will have heard of synesthesia in the context of people who can “see” music, but in reality the different sensory effects of the condition can go far beyond that. Some people can “taste” words; others “see” time, or in the case of one blind person, “feel” time as a texture. And, in the far less fun example of mirror-touch synesthesia, a small percentage of people can literally feel the bodily sensations being experienced by those around them  including pain.
                        <br>In all cases, synesthesia comes down to a crossing of the wires between different sensory processes in the brain. In trying to learn why this occurs, scientists have previously observed that autistic people are also more likely to have synesthesia, but that still left them no closer to understanding exactly what this link might be. 

                        <br>Something else that's been noticed about synesthesia is that it tends to run in families. Speculating that there could therefore be some genetic inheritance at work, a team of scientists turned to data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS), which included twins born between 1999 and 2003. 
                        
                        <br>The final sample included 2,131 pairs of twins, of which 658 were identical, 765 were non-identical but of the same sex, and 708 were non-identical and of different sexes. Participants were screened for eight of the more common types of synesthesia, including types where letters or numbers trigger the perception of a color, and also took part in an assessment for autistic traits.  
                        
                        <br>The results showed that self-reported synesthesia was strongly linked to a category of traits frequently seen in autistic people, known as the RRBI-D domain, which stands for “repetitive behaviors, restricted interests and attention to detail.” These can include things like an intense, highly-focused interest in a topic, attachment to particular objects, or performing repetitive movements such as hand-flapping (often known as self-stimulating behavior or, more colloquially, “stimming”).
                        
                        <br>“The association between individual differences in synaesthesia and autistic traits was estimated to be predominantly under genetic influence and seemed to be mainly driven by non-social autistic traits (repetitive behaviours, restricted interests and attention to detail),” the authors wrote in their paper. 
                        
                        <br>As such, they concluded that “the link between synaesthesia and autism might reside in shared genetic causes, related to non-social autistic traits such as alterations in perception.”
                        
                        <br>Whilst the genetic connection appears to play the strongest role, according to the study results, environmental factors that differed between each member of a set of twins were also implicated. The authors note that this is in line with previous research, which has shown environment to be a particular factor in the development of types of synesthesia in which numbers and letters are perceived as having colors. 
                        
                        <br>There are some limitations to the research, such as the fact that not all possible types of synesthesia could be included and the fact that the synesthesia data relied on self-reporting, which is always open to bias. But the study team is optimistic that more work will follow, to build on the evidence they've gathered and hopefully improve our understanding of both autism and synesthesia:
                        
                        <br>“We hope that our findings will inspire future research on environmental factors influencing synaesthesia, the shared genetic mechanisms of autism and synaesthesia, and the specific behavioural features shared between the two phenomena, informing their shared and non-shared aetiology.”

                    <h1>Papyrus Containing Egyptian Book Of The Dead Found Alongside Mummies At Ancient Cemetery</h1>
                    <p>Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered an exceptionally long papyrus scroll containing excerpts from the legendary Book of the Dead alongside the mummified inhabitants of an ancient cemetery. Located within the Tuna el-Gebel necropolis, the newly unearthed graveyard served as the final resting place for senior officials and priests during the New Kingdom, which existed between the sixteenth and eleventh centuries BCE.

                        <br>Announcing the discovery in a statement, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities revealed that the cemetery contained “hundreds of archaeological finds, including amulets, ornaments, and stone and wooden coffins containing mummies.” Among the preserved bodies at the site were the remains of a certain “Jahuti Miss,” who held the title of “supervisor of the bulls of the Temple of Amun”, as well as a temple musician called “Mrs Nani”.
                        
                        <br>Engravings found on another coffin indicated that it belonged to one “Mrs Ta-de-Isa”, daughter of “Eret Haru”, the high priest of a deity known as Djehuti. Alongside the coffin were two wooden boxes containing canopic jars, in which the dead woman's organs would have been stored.
                        <br>“The wooden [coffins] are in human shapes, some of which are engraved and colored. Inside are mummies in a good state of preservation,” the statement reads. However, the most striking discovery of all concerned a section of papyrus that contained references to the Book of the Dead.

                        <br>Measuring between 43 and 49 feet (13 to 15 meters) in length, the ancient paper is described as being in “good condition”, although no further details about its contents are revealed in the statement. Despite its popular name, the Egyptian Book of the Dead was not a book at all, but was actually a collection of spells that were intended to help the souls of the departed navigate the afterlife.
                        
                        <br>With no formal structure, order, or narrative, the various spells could be assembled in different combinations and buried alongside corpses. No tomb has ever been discovered with the complete collection of chapters.
                        
                        <br>The incantations included in the Book of the Dead were designed to equip the deceased with phrases that could be recited in order to overcome the many devious beings that inhabited the underworld and blocked the path to Osiris, whom all newly expired individuals had to reach in order to have their soul weighed.
                        
                        <br>Unfortunately, the statement does not indicate which spells or chapters were included in the lengthy papyrus, nor whom it was buried with.

                    <h1>Massive Heat-Emitting Mass Discovered Buried Under The Surface Of The Moon</h1>
                    <p>A large mass of granite that has been slowly releasing heat has been discovered buried underneath a crater on the Moon. This is not science fiction, it's ancient volcanism. The Moon used to have lava fields and eruptions, but astronomers had never actually found a more traditional Earth-like volcano - until they looked at what was beneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the far side of the Moon.  

                        <br>Granite is not very common outside of Earth so finding it on the Moon is very exciting. On our planet, it forms deep beneath the surface, usually under a volcano where magma can cool down and crystalize. To make granite, having water and plate tectonics helps a lot. The team used a combination of data from Chinese and American lunar orbiters to discover this heat-emitting mass below the surface, identifying a volcanic process never before seen on the Moon. 
                        
                        <br>“Using an instrument looking at microwave wavelengths - longer than infrared - sent to the Moon on both the Chinese Chang'E 1 and 2 orbiters, we have been able to map temperatures below the surface. What we found was that one of these suspected volcanoes, known as Compton-Belkovich, was absolutely glowing at microwave wavelengths,” co-lead researcher Dr Matt Siegler, of the Planetary Science Institute, said in a statement. 
                        
                        <br>“What this means is that it is hot, not necessarily at the surface, as you would see in infrared, but under the surface. The only way to explain this is from extra heat coming from somewhere below the feature within the deeper lunar crust. So Compton-Belkovich, thought to be a volcano, is also hiding a large heat source below it.”
                        
                        <br>The data shows a 20-kilometer (12-mile) wide silicon-rich surface feature that they believe is the caldera of this ancient volcano. The temperature there is 10°C (18°F) warmer than its surroundings, but it's not from magma under the surface - the last time, the volcano erupted was 3.5 billion years ago - it's from radioactive elements that were stuck in the rocks.
                        
                        <br>“We interpret this heat flux as resulting from a radiogenic-rich granite body below the caldera," Dr Siegler said. " To tell the truth, we were a bit puzzled when we found it: fortunately, my wife, Dr Rita Economos, is the geochemist in the family, so with her guidance, we were able to piece together the probable geologic cause of the heat anomaly."
                        
                        <br>As Dr Economos explains: “This find is a 50km wide batholith; a batholith is a type of volcanic rock that forms when lava rises into the earth's crust but does not erupt onto the surface. El Capitan and Half Dome, in Yosemite in California, are examples of similar granite rocks which have risen to the surface.”</p>
